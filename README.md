# twig.nvim

**twig.nvim** is a small and lightweight Taskwarrior integration plugin.

Twig is built to complement how I use my personal wiki alongside Taskwarrior for project management.

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.8.0
- Taskwarrior

## Commands

- `TwigTasksForBuffer`: list tasks associate with the current buffer.
